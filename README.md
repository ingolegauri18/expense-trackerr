To run your Expense Tracker project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites

Text Editor: Any text editor that you want to use, for example VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.
Web Browser: Any modern browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
Node.js: In case you need to run a local development server.
Steps to Run:
1. Create Project Files:
Create a folder for your project, for instance ExpenseTracker.
Inside this folder, create the following files
index.html - It is the HTML file you prepared
style.css - To add styles to your app
script.js For Java script logic, especially for tracking income/expense and rendering chart
2. Download Chart.js:
Chart.js is used via CDN in the HTML file. So, there is no setup to do for Chart.js .
Alternatively, you can download it, if you want to use it offline
Download: Chart.js
Save chart.min.js that you downloaded in your project folder. Link the chart.js locally inside index.html instead of using it via CDN in the download section.
Open index.html by double-clicking to open in a web browser. The ExpenseTracker will now load and run locally.
4. Running with a Local Server (Optional)
If you have Node.js, you can run with a local server for a really nice development experience.
Install http-server:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run this command:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Launch the server:

Open your project directory in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/ExpenseTracker
Launch the server:
bash
Copy code
http-server
Open the app:

Your browser will be pointing to a link like this, http://localhost:8080 from your terminal. Now open this up in your web browser to see the running application on Expense Tracker.
